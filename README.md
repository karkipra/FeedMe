A recipe application for Android using an external API with a login function and persistent storage options.
Created by Pratik Karki, Marty Toney, and Hüseyin Altınışık.

## Motivation

This project was created as a Final Project for Mobile Software Development at AIT-Budapest, Fall 2018. Our goal was to use all the different features we learned about Android Studio and create a fully-functioning publishable app that has real-life uses. Creating a recipe app became a common theme that we pursued as it allowed us to explore fetching data through APIs and have it be customized to be as easy as possible to use.
